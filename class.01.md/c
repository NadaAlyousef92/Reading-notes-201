+The models use objects to represent physical things.

objects can have properties that tell us about the object;
methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object 
events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.

+Programmers can write code to say "when this event occurs,run that code."

+Web browser use HTML markup to create a model of the web page,each element creates its own node(a kind of object).
