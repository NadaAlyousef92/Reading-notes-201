# **Functions methods and objects**

-Function allow you to group a set of related statements togather that represent asingle task

-Functions can take parameters (inf required to do their job) and may return a value

-An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around us.

-In an object ,variables are known as properties of the object ;functions are known as methods of the object

-Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.

- Javascript also has several built-in objects such as string,number,math,and data. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help to write scripts.

-Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data sets and both can contain the other.

## **Document object model**

-(DOM) specifies how browsers should create amodel of an html page and hoe javaScript can access and update the content of a web page while it is in the browser window
-(DOM) its has separate set of rules and its not a part of html or javaScript, its implemented by all major browser makers and covers two primary areas:

1.Making the model of html page
2.accessing and changing the html page

-(DOM)Tree is a model of web page and it have four types of nodes
1-document nodes(
2.elements nodes
3.attribute nodes
4.text nodes

-You canselect elements nodes by their id or class attributes by tag name or using CSS selector syntax

-Whenever a DOM query can return more than one it will always return a nodeList

-From an element node you can accessand update its content using properties such as textcontent and innerHTML or using (DOM) mainipulation techniques

-An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other

-In order to browsers , implementation of the DOM inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery)

-Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree
